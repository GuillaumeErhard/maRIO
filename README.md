# maRIO
A program to control remotly a robot, with a NI myRio, a PC or an Ipad via wifi, and done under Labview and the National Instrument app. This project was done at the end of my bachelor degree, in a team a 5 person that I led. I also did 90 % of the code you can see here, as the woodworking necessary.

If you want to reuse this code, be free to do so.  

To accomodate to a  QWERTY setup, simply change values picked by  `Keyboard_mode.vi` .
And to make the core function works for your own change the bit frame picked by the different SubVi contained in the MyRio SubVi directory.
